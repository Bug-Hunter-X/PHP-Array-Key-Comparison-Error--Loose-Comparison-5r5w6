# PHP Array Key Comparison Error: Loose Comparison

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP related to comparing array keys using loose comparison (`==`).  This can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs when keys are of different data types.

The `bug.php` file shows the incorrect code. The `bugSolution.php` file provides a corrected version using strict comparison (`===`).

This is a common pitfall for PHP developers, especially when working with arrays and external data sources.
